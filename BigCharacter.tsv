She adopted the direwolf Nymeria, but they have since been separated after Nymeria attacked Joffrey, forcing Arya to send her away in order to prevent her execution.  When her father is betrayed and executed by Joffrey, Arya flees the capital with the help of the Night's Watch recruiter, Yoren, who gets her out of the city disguised as an orphan boy ""Arry"" and tries to take her home. However, she is taken prisoner by Ser Gregor Clegane's men and taken to Harrenhal, where she briefly serves as cupbearer to an unsuspecting Tywin Lannister. After escaping, she begins making her way towards Riverrun and is captured by the Brotherhood Without Banners and subsequently by Sandor Clegane. They travel across Westeros as he unsuccessfully attempts to ransom her to various family members. In Clegane's company, Arya becomes increasingly hardened and brutalized, and personally kills a number of men. She compiles a list of people she intends to kill.

He breaks an oath to marry a daughter of his ally Walder Frey, choosing instead to marry Talisa Maegyr, and he entrusts Theon Greyjoy to negotiate an alliance with the ironborn, but Theon betrays him and seizes Winterfell. Robb then alienates the Karstarks, who make up nearly half of his remaining army, when he executes their leader Rickard Karstark, after Rickard kills two young Lannister boys.  With the war turning against him, Robb is forced to turn to the Freys again. He seemingly wins back their support by agreeing for his uncle Edmure Tully to marry Roslin Frey. Unbeknownst to Robb, it is a trap, as the Freys and Stark bannerman Roose Bolton are now in league with Tywin Lannister. At the wedding feast, despite invoking guest right, the Freys turn on the Starks, and Robb, Catelyn, Talisa and most of his army are massacred in what becomes known as the Red Wedding.

Jaime is involved in an incestuous relationship with Cersei, and, unknown to most, is the biological father of her three children, Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen.  Jaime visits Winterfell in King Robert's entourage; he pushes Bran Stark from a window when Bran sees him having intercourse with Cersei. Bran survives but is paralyzed from the waist down and has no memory of the event. When war breaks out with the Starks, Jaime leaves his King's Landing to join his father in the Riverlands.

Joffrey was originally betrothed to Sansa Stark, whom he kept captive in King's Landing after he beheaded her father for treason, as Eddard Stark tried to reveal the truth about his parentage. However, he later set Sansa aside in favor of Margaery Tyrell, as part of the new alliance between House Lannister, the primary supporters of Joffrey, and House Tyrell, the ruling house of the Reach whose support helped save King's Landing from Stannis Baratheon's attack.

His primary goal was to end the war: he arranged the marriage of Petyr Baelish to Lysa Arryn, the Regent of the Vale, to bring her back into the fold and backed House Bolton and House Frey in their betrayal of the Starks at the infamous Red Wedding, which ended the Northern rebellion. After the death of King Joffrey, Tywin led the trial against his son, Tyrion, who was accused of the deed. When Tyrion lost his trial by combat, Tywin sentenced his son to death.
